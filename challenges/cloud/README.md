# Summary

The Teleport Cloud offering is new; we're on a journey of defining and building a culture around production, offering a secure and reliable hosted version of Teleport Enterprise as a service. 

To learn more about the teams that are a part of Teleport Cloud, visit our [Engineering Teams](../../teams.md) page.


# Rationale

The Teleport Cloud team uses both coding challenges and hands on Linux administration puzzles to evaluate candidates depending on their role. These exercises have two goals:

- It helps us understand what to expect from you as an engineer, how you reason about production systems and investigate faults.
- It helps you get a feel for what it would be like to work at Teleport, as this exercise aims to simulate some of our day-as-usual and expose you to the type of work we're doing here.

We believe this technique is better and is more fun compared to whiteboard/quiz interviews so common in the industry. It's not without the downsides as it could take longer than traditional interviews. [Some of the best teams use coding challenges.](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/)

We appreciate your time and are looking forward to hacking on this challenge together.


# Backgrounds

## Development Focus: Systems / Backend Developers
Systems developers on the platform team leverage a strong background in software development to build, maintain, deploy core production services.

### Challenge
1. [Systems developer challenge](../systems/challenge.md)

### Levels
See [levels.pdf](../../levels.pdf)


## Operations Focus: Devops / DevSecOps / SREs / Production engineers / etc
Team members with experience in various operations focused disciplines are focussed on the day to day delivery of platform components, such as build/testing automation of infrastructure as code, deploying and configuring our metrics, alarming and logging systems, automating build pipeliness, and other day to day activities to enable our cloud infrastructure.


### Challenge
We use two interviews for team members with operational backgrounds, the first is a lightweight scripting / programming challenge, and the second is a troubleshooting production test. See the following links for outlines of each challenge.
1. [Automation development challenge](automation.md)
2. [Troubleshooting challenge](troubleshooting.md)

Note: These levels are used as a guide, not every engineer specifically matches every skill in every focus area of the guide. Higher level engineers are expected to have a broader set of skills than junior team members. Engineers that focus on certain disciplines do not require as broad an area of skills, such as team members focussing on Tooling may not require as deep network understanding. All team members are expected to meet Communications, Security, Oncall, and Operations requirements.
<br />
Note: Our production and operational culture is still new, and you will be expected to help us shape it
