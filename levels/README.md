# Engineering Levels

The linked matrices below explain the requirements for all engineering
specialities and levels at Teleport.

For Levels 1-3 engineers must meet the requirements for all specialities.
Starting from Level 4 engineers will typically focus on one specialty.

Not all skills go to Level 6. This is determined by the focus of Teleport.

For example, security skills are more relevant, as we are a security oriented
company, and we are interested in R&D Level 6 engineers, however OS/tooling is
not the primary focus, so basic levels are satisfactory.

As the level advances past 4, the focus shifts from technical skills to
bringing products to market, as it's more relevant to Teleport as a for-profit
startup.

Skills are a mix of technical and communication abilities. Some references to
security are based on the coding challenge.
