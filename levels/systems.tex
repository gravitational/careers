    Demonstrates good understanding of basic data structures like hash tables,
    linked lists, and trees. Can reason about algorithm complexity. Applies relevant
    data structures in day to day activity.

    \bigbreak

    Can implement a production quality software - it might be not the most
    efficient or secure, but correct.
    &

    Applies basic security principles to program design. For example, can set
    up HTTPS and password based auth.
    &

    Reports progress on a regular basis as required by the team's operational
    requirements. Actively solicits feedback.Participates on interview panels.
    &

    Understands and reasons about networking concepts. Understands and can
    write production quality web servers. Understands common networking issues and
    troubleshooting techniques.
    &

    Understands the usage of POSIX and other APIs for Linux systems.

    Understands synchronization primitives and their application, including
    reasoning about deadlocks and data races. Can write basic system-level code
    using the different types of memory and allocation. Understands inter process
    communication and can build systems leveraging it. Can implement data race and
    deadlock free code using basic production guidelines - using synchronization
    primitives and properly sharing state between components of the system.
    &

    Understands the usage of compilers, interpreters, build tools at the organization.

    \cellcolor{blue!25}
    Can write high quality user and product focused documentation.
    &

    &

    Applies industry best practices and security guidelines, like setting up
    strong TLS, can pick strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    &

    Provides constructive review on peers' code and design. Helps new team
    members during their first weeks.
    &

    Has more granular understanding of the networking design, for example can
    reason about using GRPC vs HTTPS-JSON and their networking and scalability
    trade-offs. Can do the same for UDP vs TCP and lower level protocols.
    &

    Can reason about performance implications and risks of using
    synchronization primitives, understands granularity of locking, can debug and
    troubleshoot memory and synchronization issues.
    &

    Understands tools and compilers as an advanced user - for example, can
    refactor Makefiles to make them more efficient and parallel execution friendly
    or select the optimal set of compiler flags for Linux and macOS.

    3&

    \cellcolor{blue!25}
    Collaborates with the team to scope requirements, based on good
    understanding of existing longer term product vision and estimates of the
    system design of a feature of a product.
    &

    Uses advanced data structures and algorithms, such as consensus, gossip
    protocols to implement key product features.
    &

    Understands security aspects of protocols on a deeper level, for example
    can explain differences between TLS 1.2 and 1.3 and security implications.
    Understands common attack vectors for server side or client side applications.

    \bigbreak

    Can build secure systems that will pass quality security audit that will
    uncover few to no critical system design errors.
    &

    Supports less experienced peers' technical skills, answering questions and
    being a resource. Documents and improves team practices.
    &

    Understands scalability and resilience aspects of practical implementation
    of systems leveraging networking.

    \bigbreak

    Can write fast, scalable servers and troubleshoot common networking issues
    such as connection lifecycle, pooling, backpressure and other aspects of the
    application design.
    &

    Not only can write data-race and deadlock free code, but implements safe
    and concurrent and/or parallel systems using minimum amount of shared state,
    granular locking - systems that are easy to read, extend and troubleshoot.
    
    \bigbreak
