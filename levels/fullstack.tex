    Can use frameworks to mitigate common attack vectors for server side (like
    secure password storage) or client side web applications (like XSS, CSRF, and
    SSRF) security vulnerabilities.
    &

    Supports less experienced peers' technical skills, answering questions and
    being a resource. Documents and improves team practices.
    &

    Understands scalability and resilience aspects of practical implementation
    of systems leveraging networking.

    \bigbreak

    Frontend designs are informed by scalable backends, networking techniques
    such as pagination, connection pooling, backpressure and other aspects of the
    application design.
